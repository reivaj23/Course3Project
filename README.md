Getting &amp; Cleaning Data course project

The assignment consists of getting the data from the UCI experiment, and clean the data by filtering through the measurements in the dataset, and obtaining only those on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Information on the experiment can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Per the UCI website, the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity data was captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity identifier.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt': File with description of the assignment.
- 'mydata.txt': Dataset after data cleaning.
- 'Codebook.Rmd': Codebook detailing the content of the dataset.
